                The word “Gospel” means “good news.” It is the good news of how you can have a loving, personal
                relationship
                with God that gives meaning and purpose to this life, and, at the same time, gives you the certainty
                that you
                will spend eternity with Him in heaven.
                Many people today claim that they are preaching the Gospel, yet they all seem to have different
                messages.

                Why do we hear so many different messages today? Is there more than one gospel? What really is “The

                Earlier we learned that because God is infinitely Holy, even the smallest sin is infinitely offensive to
                Him. As a result, an infinite payment must be made for the sins of each and every person. Now there are
                two ways by which an infinite payment can be offered: a finite person could suffer God’s wrath for an
                infinite period of time, or an infinite person could suffer God’s wrath for a finite period of time.
                Both yield an infinite payment for sin.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Man, who is finite, would therefore have to suffer God’s wrath for infinity if he were to pay for
                    his own sins. That is why hell is eternal.

                <li>
                    Jesus Christ, the infinite God in human form, would have to suffer God’s wrath for a finite amount
                    of time. Since He is God, the suffering He endured on the cross was a sacrifice of infinite value.
                    Therefore, His death made available the infinite payment necessary to pay for the sins of all men
                    throughout all ages.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                An infinite payment must be made for every man’s sins. God allows each person to decide which payment
                plan he prefers . . . Jesus Christ or eternity in hell.

                The word “grace” means something which is given freely . . . without cost or obligation. For example, if

                Of course not. It becomes a debt which he owes you the moment he accepts your money! Your friend would
                probably be insulted, withdraw the gift and say: “I’m not giving this to you because I have to. It is a
                gift. Do you accept my gift or not?”

                The same is true with God’s offer of eternal life. People try to purchase eternal life by obeying the
                Ten Commandments, living a good life, going to church, or some other religious work. But God will not
                make Himself a debtor to any man! He does not “owe” eternal life to anyone. He will offer it only as a
                gift!

                <li>
                    Saving repentance is not being sorry for your sins.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Saving repentance is not turning from your sins or reforming your life.

                <li>
                    Saving repentance is not the willingness to turn your life over to God so that He can direct your

            </ol>

                Saving repentance has absolutely nothing to do with regretting your sins or resolving to turn from

            <h2 class="sub-topic">what saving repentance is:</h2>
            <p>
                Saving repentance is to stop trusting in gaining eternal life through religion, religious rituals,
                or obedience to God’s laws.
            </p>
            <p>
                The word “repent” comes from the Greek word which means “to change one’s mind.” Those who believe that
                eternal life can be earned through good works are commanded in Scripture to change their mind or
                “repent.” They are told to stop trusting in their works, and come to God on the basis of grace through
                faith alone.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>In Matthew 3:7-9</strong> some religious men believed that they were going to heaven because
                they were
                descendents of Abraham, the father of the Jewish people. God Himself had chosen the Jewish people and
                established their religion. These men believed that because they were the right religion that they would
                go to heaven. John the Baptist told them that they must repent. That is, they must stop trusting in
                their religion to get them to heaven.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Luke 13:1-5</strong> tells of a tower in Jerusalem that collapsed and killed 18 people. The
                Jewish mind
                searched
                for an answer for this tragedy. They realized that only God can know the secret thoughts and deeds of
                another man. Perhaps then, they reasoned, those 18 persons on whom the tower of Siloam fell were
                actually the 18 worst sinners in all Jerusalem. God could have gathered them together at the appointed
                time and place to execute his righteous judgment. This however would mean that only the very worst
                sinners are worthy of God’s judgment. The rest of Jerusalem (those who had not been killed by the
                falling tower) had apparently led good enough lives that they were not under God’s judgment. To believe
                this sort of reasoning, however, is to believe that salvation is earned by the works of the law. Jesus
                warned those who believed this way that they were facing eternal
                condemnation. He commanded them to repent - to abandon all hope of securing a right standing before
                God by the works of the law, and trust in God alone for their salvation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>In Hebrews 9:9-14</strong> the Bible calls sacraments or religious rituals through which men try
                to reach
                God
                “dead works.” A few chapters earlier, the same author tells us in Hebrews 6:1 that the “foundation” of
                the Christian faith is “repentance from dead works and faith towards God.” That is to say, one must stop
                trusting in “dead works” (i.e. religious rituals, sacraments, etc.) before he can exercise a genuine
                saving faith in God.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Biblical command is clear. If a man believes that his religion will get him into heaven, he must
                repent, (Matthew 3:7-9). If he believes that obeying the laws of God are necessary to get him into
                heaven, he must repent (Luke 13:1-5). And if he believes that he must perform some religious ritual or
                sacrament to be saved, he must repent, and stop trusting in any of those things to save him (Hebrews
                6:1). Like the person on page 14, he must put his “money” back in his pocket and accept eternal life as
                a free gift!
            </p>
            <img class="body-img" src="014_saving_repentance.png" alt="">
            <p>
                Saving faith does not simply affirm that Jesus’ death is “necessary,” it must affirm that His death is
                enough! That it is sufficient all by itself to pay for your sins apart from any human effort or good
                work, and that it is a free gift available only through faith, and apart from any human effort or good
                work. (See Galatians 2:21, 3:10-14, 5:1-4; Romans 4:4-5, 4:14).

                Go back to the <a href="#page2-div">three helpful questions</a>. What was your answer to “why God should
                let you into heaven?” If you said you must be
                baptized, live a good life, or anything else other than simply trusting in Jesus, you must repent. You
                must stop trusting in any religious things you have done in the past or might do in the future, and
                trust on Christ alone.

                Since sin separates man from God, and since Jesus paid for our sins at the cross, man can have a

                One does not lose the gift of eternal life because of sin. That’s the very reason that Christ died . . .
                to pay for your sins! It is because He died for all sins forever — past, present and future — that He is
                able once and for all to declare you not guilty . . . not only of our past sins, but of all your sins:
                past, present and future! To refuse to believe this is to refuse to believe the very gospel itself!

                Although no sin can ever deprive a believer of the eternal life that was freely bestowed upon him once
                and for all, sin nevertheless has grave consequences both in this life and in the life to come.

            <p>
                A person who drinks to excess may kill himself or an innocent victim in an automobile accident. One who
                engages in immoral sexual activity may contract an STD. Knowing Christ as Savior will save one from
                hell,
                but it will not save one from the natural consequences of sinful or foolish living. (See Galatians
                6:7-8; James 2:14-17).

                Receiving a free ticket to a sports event guarantees one entrance into the stadium, but it does not
                guarantee one a front row seat. Similarly, receiving the free gift of eternal life through faith in
                Jesus Christ guarantees a person entrance into God’s eternal kingdom, but in no way guarantees one an
                exalted position in that kingdom! Our position in heaven and the rewards associated with that position
                are totally dependent upon the holy life and godly works which we manifest in this lifetime.

                While the pleasures of sin in this life may at
                times appear more important than some distant hope of future rewards in heaven, Scripture teaches that
                those who barter away their “inheritance” (their future rewards in heaven) for the pleasures of sin
                will one day weep uncontrollably when they see the unspeakable rewards which they forfeited when they
                pursued their own sinful pleasures in this lifetime.

                        Since the gospel is the corneerstone of the Christian faith, Satan will immediately begin his
                        attack by trying to confuse you about the truth of the gospel. To withstand the assault you are
                        about to face, you must become firmly rooted in the truth of the gospel. To do this, determine
                        right now that you will read this booklet once a day for an entire month. Don’t stop after ten
                        or fifteen days even if you have memorized it! And above all, don’t let Satan discourage you
                        by telling you that you “don’t have time,” or that you have “more important things to do.” This
                        is a classic lie of Satan. Don’t believe it. (Matthew 13:1-9, 18-23, 8:21-22; Luke 10:38-42,
                        12:16-31, 14:16-20; Ephesians 5:16).

                        Don’t try to gain assurance of your relationship with Christ or grow in spiritual truth through
                        “mystical feelings” or “quite little voices” inside your head. What we “feel” in our heart is no
                        more reliable a guide to spiritual truth than it is to truths concerning mathematics or
                        geography. Would you try to drive hundreds of miles of back country roads in the fog without a
                        roadmap simply by trusting your “feelings?” Of course not! And yet this is how many people
                        foolishly try to live their Christian lives!

                        In order for us to grow in spiritual truth, God has given us a source of truth that is sure and
                        steadfast. It is called the Bible. Try to read your Bible every day. Start by reading the Book
                        of Galatians. It is St. Paul’s defense of the gospel and the doctrine of grace. Read one chapter
                        each day until you have read the entire book (six chapters) five times. This will take one
                        month. In the next month, read through the entire book once a day. This will firmly establish
                        you in some of the most basic and important doctrines of the Christian faith, providing the kind
                        of foundation that is essential for sound Christian growth.

                        Once you have become rooted in your understanding of the gospel, find a good church. To do this,
                        ask the pastor how one gets to heaven. If he says it is through living a good life, obeying the
                        Ten Commandments, baptism, confession, church membership, or some other incorrect answer—turn
                        around and look for another church. If the pastor doesn’t even know the gospel, the most basic
                        belief of the Christian faith, then he doesn’t even know the first thing about Christianity! Why
                        would you want to go to a church where the pastor doesn’t even know how to get to heaven? Find a
                        good church!

                stopping to thank Him! So that you don’t follow the example of the nine ungrateful lepers, you can show

                Imagine that one day you are walking down a sidewalk, and a piano that was being hoisted into a tenth
                story apartment breaks loose, and is falling toward you without your knowledge. All of a sudden, someone
                you have never met runs over to you and pushes you out of the way to save you, only to be crushed
                himself by the falling piano. As he lies dying, his trembling hand takes a letter from his pocket, and
                he asks you to take it and deliver it for him. Would you? Of course you would!
            </p>
            <p>
                Jesus, who died to save you, has left such a letter with you. That letter is called The Gospel. “And He
                said to them, ‘Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature,’” Mark 16:15. (Also see
                Matthew 28:18-20, Acts 1:8, Romans 10:14-15). Are you willing to take the letter that Jesus has left
                with you and try to do as He has asked?
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are, simply ask a friend or an acquaintance: “Has anyone ever shown you from the Bible how you
                can know for certain that you will go to heaven when you die?” If they say “no,” simply ask “May I?”
                Most people will be eager to find out how they can know this for sure. If they are interested, simply
                sit down and take time to share this little booklet with them. They will be eternally grateful!

            <p>
                Today a variety of “gospel” messages flood the air waves and pul- pits across the globe. They range from
                sentimental overtures encouraging the lost sinner to “invite Jesus into his heart,” to threatening
                admonitions requiring the unbeliever to “repent of his sins.” Not surprisingly, believer and unbeliever
                alike have been left in a state of total confusion. Even when the gospel is proclaimed clearly and
                accurately, the hearer will often filter the words of the evangelist through a preexisting grid of false
                gospels which he has already heard, so failing to understand the saving message of Jesus Christ. With
                this in mind, The Gospel Booklet was written not only to explain and illustrate those concepts
                essential to saving faith such as our Lord’s atoning death and the doctrine of grace, but to address and
                correct much of the false teaching that is so often associated with the Christian gospel. Clarifying so
                many complex theological issues in this short, easy-to-read booklet took close to five years of writing
                and editing. We know of no booklet in print today that presents the gospel more clearly or accurately.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is our desire to see The Gospel Booklet achieve the widest possible circulation. Through the
                efforts of numerous churches and mission organizations, The Gospel Booklet has already been translated
                into some of the world’s major languages. Christian organizations in foreign countries are typically
                granted written permission to translate or print The Gospel Booklet from their own facilities in the
                native tongue. If you would like to see it made available in a country or a language where it is not
                currently available, we invite you to contact us. Let’s work together to make The Gospel Booklet
                available to all people in all languages.
